PartyLoud is a tool to create fake internet traffic
in order to mitigate tracking on local networks.  
The idea behind this script is that if you make a lot of noise on the 
network (in form of http requests) it wold be less easy for a attacker to
track your real navigation.  

This project was inspired by [noisy.py](https://github.com/1tayH/noisy "noisy.py")

##### :warning: PartyLoud has been tested only on Debian 9 and Mac OSX 10.14 :warning:

## `FAQ`

<details>
  <summary>Isn't this literally just a cli based frontend to curl?</summary>
  <p>The core of the script is a curl request, but this tool does more than that. When you run the script, several threads are started. Each thread makes a different Http request and parse the output to choose the next url, simulating a navigation. Unless user stop the script (either pressing enter or via CTRL-C), it will stay alive</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is error recovery mechanism based on try - catches? </summary>
  <p>Try-catch mechanism doesn't really exist in bash, error recovery mechanism is an elegant way to say that if the http request return a status code starting with 4 or 5 (error) the script will use a backup-url on order to continue execution normally</p>

  <summary>How easy is this fake traffic to detect?</summary>
  <p>Unfortunatly it's preatty easy, but keep in mind that this is a beta release and in next releases I'll fix this "issue"</p>
