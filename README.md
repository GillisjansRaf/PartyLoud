## ðŸ“– `FAQ`

<details>
  <summary>Isn't this literally just a cli based frontend to curl?</summary>
  <p>The core of the script is a curl request, but this tool does more than that. When you run the script, several threads are started. Each thread makes a different Http request and parse the output to choose the next url, simulating a navigation. Unless user stop the script (either pressing enter or via CTRL-C), it will stay alive</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is error recovery mechanism based on try - catches? </summary>
  <p>Try-catch mechanism doesn't really exist in bash, error recovery mechanism is an elegant way to say that if the http request return a status code starting with 4 or 5 (error) the script will use a backup-url on order to continue execution normally</p>

  <summary>Can I fork your project?</summary>

<details>
  <summary>How easy is this fake traffic to detect?</summary>
  <p>Unfortunatly it's preatty easy, but keep in mind that this is a beta release and in next releases I'll fix this "issue"</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What badwords is doing?</summary>
  <p>badwords is just a list of keywords used to filter urls in order to prevent 404s and non-html contents (like images, css, js). You can create your own, but, unless you have special needs, I recommend you to use default one or at least to use it as a template</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What partyloud.conf is doing?</summary>
  <p>partyloud.conf is just a list of root urls used to start fake navigation, you can create your own conf file, but pay attention, the more url you add, the more thread you start. This is an "open issue", next releases will come with a max thread number in order to avoid fork bombs (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-bomb/)</p>
